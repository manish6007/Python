# Personal Wealth & Portfolio Tracker — Product Plan

A single place to track the complete financial life of a household (self + spouse):
investments, liabilities, cashflow, and savings opportunities — with an exportable
PDF snapshot that can be fed to Claude (or any AI) for optimization suggestions.

Built first for personal use, then hardened for sharing with friends/family, and
finally productized for monetization.

---

## 1. Vision & Goals

- **One dashboard** for total net worth across every asset class the household owns.
- **Household view**: my folios + wife's investments, tagged by owner, viewable
  together or separately.
- **Cashflow intelligence**: salary in, expenses out, EMIs, SIPs — surface the
  *monthly investible surplus* and suggest where it should go based on target
  asset allocation.
- **AI-ready export**: one-click PDF/JSON snapshot (with a privacy-safe mode)
  designed to be pasted into Claude for portfolio review and optimization.
- **Trust first**: this is the most sensitive data a person has. Privacy and
  security decisions are made in Phase 1, not bolted on later.

## 2. Asset Classes & Modules to Cover

### 2.1 Investments (Assets)
| Module | Key fields | Valuation source |
|---|---|---|
| Mutual Funds | Folio no., scheme, units, avg NAV, SIP details, category (equity/debt/hybrid/ELSS) | AMFI NAV feed (free, daily) |
| Direct Stocks | Ticker, exchange (NSE/BSE), qty, avg buy price, demat account | NSE/BSE EOD prices or yfinance |
| Gold | Physical (grams, purity), SGB (units, interest dates, maturity), Gold ETF/MF | IBJA gold rate / NAV |
| REITs / InvITs | Units, avg price, distributions received | Exchange price |
| Fixed Deposits | Bank, principal, rate, start/maturity date, payout type, auto-renew | Computed accrual |
| Savings Accounts | Bank, balance (manual or via import), rate | Manual/statement import |
| PF (EPF) | Balance, monthly contribution (employee+employer), rate | Manual + annual passbook entry |
| PPF | Account, balance, yearly contributions, maturity date, current rate | Computed accrual |
| NPS | PRAN, Tier I/II, scheme allocation (E/C/G), units | NPS NAV feed |
| Other investments | Bonds, P2P, crypto, ESOP/RSU, unlisted shares, real estate, insurance with investment component (ULIP/endowment), cash | Manual value + optional feed |

### 2.2 Liabilities
- **Home loan**: outstanding principal, rate (and rate-reset history), EMI,
  tenure remaining, amortization schedule, prepayment tracking, prepayment
  vs. invest what-if calculator.
- Other loans: car, personal, credit card revolving balance, loan against securities.

### 2.3 Income & Expenses
- **Salary**: net credit per month per earner; bonus/variable pay as one-offs.
- Other income: rent, dividends, FD/SGB interest, distributions.
- **Expenses**: category-wise monthly tracking (manual entry first; statement
  CSV import later; UPI/AA integration much later). Fixed vs. discretionary split.
- **Committed outflows**: EMIs, SIPs, insurance premiums, school fees — the
  recurring skeleton of the month.

### 2.4 Derived Intelligence (the real product)
- **Net worth**: total, by owner, by asset class, trend over time (monthly snapshots).
- **Asset allocation**: actual vs. target (user-defined, e.g. 60/25/10/5
  equity/debt/gold/cash), drift alerts.
- **Monthly investible cashflow** = income − expenses − EMIs − committed
  investments. Shown with a suggestion engine (rule-based first):
  - Emergency fund gap → liquid fund/FD first.
  - Allocation drift → direct surplus to underweight class.
  - Tax buckets → 80C remaining (ELSS/PPF), NPS 80CCD(1B).
  - High-interest debt → prepay before investing.
- **Savings opportunities**: idle savings-account balance above threshold,
  FDs earning below current best rates, expense categories trending up,
  duplicate/overlapping MF schemes, high expense-ratio regular plans vs. direct.
- **Goal tracking** (v2): retirement, house, education — mapped to holdings.
- **XIRR** per holding / per asset class / overall (money-weighted return).

## 3. AI Optimization Loop (differentiator)

1. **Export snapshot** as PDF (human-readable report) and JSON (machine-readable).
   Contents: net worth summary, allocation vs. target, holdings tables, XIRR,
   liabilities, cashflow summary, expense breakdown.
2. **Privacy-safe mode**: strips names, account/folio numbers, PRAN, bank names —
   keeps amounts, categories, rates, dates. This is the version fed to AI.
3. **Prompt template shipped with the export** ("You are a fee-only advisor.
   Review this portfolio for allocation drift, overlap, cost, tax efficiency…")
   so the user gets consistent, high-quality reviews from Claude.
4. Later (paid tier): built-in "Ask AI" using the Claude API — the app calls
   claude-sonnet-5/claude-fable-5 directly with the anonymized snapshot, renders
   the review in-app, and keeps a history of past reviews to track whether
   suggestions were acted on.
5. **Guardrails**: always label AI output as "educational, not investment
   advice" — this matters legally (see §8).

## 4. Data Entry & Automation Strategy

Phase the pain of data entry:
1. **Manual first** (MVP): clean, fast forms + bulk CSV import templates per
   asset type. Editing must be effortless — this decides whether you keep using it.
2. **Semi-automatic**: parse standard statements users already get:
   - CAMS/KFintech Consolidated Account Statement (CAS) PDF → all MF folios
     (both spouses) in one import. This one feature removes 70% of manual work.
   - NSDL/CDSL CAS → demat holdings.
   - Broker tradebook CSVs (Zerodha/Groww/Upstox formats).
3. **Automatic prices, manual balances**: NAVs (AMFI), stock EOD prices, gold
   rate, NPS NAV auto-refresh daily; bank/EPF balances stay manual or imported.
4. **Account Aggregator (AA) framework** (monetization phase only): true
   auto-sync of bank/deposits via Setu/Finvu — requires being an AA client
   (FIU), regulatory overhead; not worth it for personal use.

## 5. Architecture & Tech Stack

### MVP (personal use, 2–4 weekends)
- **Streamlit + Python + SQLite** — fastest path given a Python repo; forms,
  tables, charts (plotly), and PDF export (reportlab/weasyprint) out of the box.
- Local-only data, single file DB → trivially private, easy backup.
- Modules: `models/` (SQLAlchemy), `pricing/` (AMFI, yfinance, gold), `importers/`
  (CAS/CSV parsers), `analytics/` (net worth, allocation, XIRR, suggestions),
  `export/` (PDF/JSON), `app.py` (UI).

### Share-with-others (Phase 3)
- Re-platform UI: **FastAPI backend + React/Next.js frontend** (or keep Streamlit
  briefly with auth), **PostgreSQL**, hosted (Railway/Fly/Vercel+Supabase).
- Multi-tenancy: `household → users → accounts → holdings → transactions`.
- Auth: email+OTP or Google sign-in; 2FA for good measure.

### Data model core (design this correctly on day 1)
```
User (household member)      Account (broker/bank/AMC, owner → User)
Holding (account, asset, qty, cost basis)
Transaction (buy/sell/SIP/dividend/interest/contribution/EMI/prepayment)
PriceHistory (asset, date, price/NAV)
Snapshot (monthly net-worth & allocation freeze — powers trends)
ExpenseEntry / IncomeEntry (date, category, amount, owner)
Target (allocation targets, goals)
```
Transactions-first (not balances-first) wherever possible — it unlocks XIRR,
capital gains, and history for free. Balance-only assets (EPF, savings) store
periodic balance observations instead.

## 6. Security & Privacy (non-negotiable, even for personal use)

- Encrypt DB at rest (SQLCipher locally; KMS-managed encryption hosted).
- Never store bank credentials; imports are read-only files.
- Mask account/folio numbers in UI by default (show last 4).
- Anonymized export mode (see §3) as the default for AI sharing.
- Hosted phase: TLS everywhere, per-tenant row isolation, audit log, encrypted
  backups, delete-my-data button (DPDP Act 2023 compliance in India).
- No selling of data, ever — say it in the privacy policy; it's the product's trust moat.

## 7. Roadmap

**Phase 1 — Personal MVP (use it yourself, ~4–6 weeks part-time)**
- Manual entry + CSV import for all asset classes in §2.1/2.2
- AMFI NAV + stock EOD auto-pricing; FD/PPF accrual math
- Net worth dashboard (total, by owner, by class), allocation pie, monthly snapshot
- Income/expense entry, monthly investible surplus calculation
- Rule-based investment suggestions + savings opportunities list
- PDF/JSON export with privacy-safe mode + Claude prompt template

**Phase 2 — Make it stick (validate on yourself, 4 weeks)**
- CAMS/KFintech CAS PDF importer (game-changer for MF)
- XIRR, net-worth trend charts, allocation drift alerts
- Home-loan amortization + prepay-vs-invest calculator
- 80C/80CCD tax-bucket tracker
- The test: do *you* update it monthly without forcing yourself? If not, fix
  friction before adding anything.

**Phase 3 — Share with a small circle (2–3 months)**
- Re-platform to hosted multi-user (FastAPI/Postgres), auth, household sharing
- Onboarding flow, empty states, mobile-responsive UI
- Feedback loop with 10–20 trusted users; watch retention (do they return monthly?)

**Phase 4 — Monetize**
- **Freemium**: free = manual tracking + dashboard; paid (₹99–199/mo or
  ₹999–1499/yr) = CAS auto-import, AI reviews in-app, tax reports, goal tracking,
  family sharing.
- Alternatives: one-time lifetime price (India converts better), B2B2C via
  fee-only advisors (they manage clients on it), affiliate income (direct-plan
  platforms, FD marketplaces) — only with disclosure.
- Competition to study: INDmoney, ET Money, Kuvera, Zerodha console, MProfit,
  Fold Money. Your wedge = household-level view + AI optimization loop +
  privacy-first (no data selling, no cross-selling).

## 8. Risks & Compliance (before monetizing in India)

- **Investment advice is regulated (SEBI RIA)**: rule-based nudges and AI
  "educational analysis" must be clearly disclaimed as not investment advice;
  personalized "buy X fund" recommendations for a fee require an RIA license.
  Keep suggestions generic ("increase debt allocation") not product-specific.
- **DPDP Act 2023**: consent, purpose limitation, deletion rights once you hold
  others' data.
- **Data-source fragility**: AMFI/NSE endpoints and CAS formats change; build
  importers defensively with format-version tests.
- **Key-person risk**: it's a side project — automate pricing refresh and
  backups so a busy month doesn't kill the data.

## 9. Success Metrics

- Phase 1–2: you update it monthly for 3 consecutive months; export→Claude
  review actually changes an investment decision at least once.
- Phase 3: ≥50% of invited users active in month 2.
- Phase 4: conversion to paid ≥3–5%, churn <5%/mo.

## 10. Immediate Next Steps

1. Freeze the data model (§5) and target allocation format.
2. Scaffold Streamlit + SQLite app with the module layout above.
3. Build MF + stocks + FD modules first (bulk of most portfolios), with AMFI
   pricing and the net-worth dashboard.
4. Add cashflow (salary/expense/EMI) and the surplus + suggestions engine.
5. Ship the PDF/JSON export with the Claude prompt template — close the AI loop.
6. Live with it for a month; let real friction drive Phase 2 priorities.
