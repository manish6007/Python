    Comparing summed interest saved against a compounded investment gain --
    which is what this used to do -- is comparing two different things: one
    is nominal rupees spread over years, the other is a terminal figure, and
    a rupee saved in year 17 is not a rupee today. It also handed the whole
    benefit of the freed EMI to the investing side, when prepaying is
    precisely what frees an EMI early.

    So both strategies are run to the same horizon (the original payoff
    date) and their terminal net worth is compared:

      * prepay -- shorter schedule, then the whole EMI is invested from the
        early payoff to the horizon;
      * invest -- the lumpsum is invested, the EMI keeps being paid to the
        original end, and nothing is freed.

    Also returns the breakeven return: the rate at which the two strategies
    tie. That is the number that survives a disagreement about "12%", since
    the reader can judge it against their own expectation.

# These follow conventions commonly used by Indian fee-only planners and SEBI
# RIA material. They are starting points for a conversation, not advice, and
# every number is meant to be edited by the user:
#   * Equity via the classic "100 minus age" rule, floored at 20% and capped
#     at 80% so neither extreme of age lands somewhere silly.
#   * Gold 10% -- the midpoint of the 5-15% diversifier range most planners
#     and the World Gold Council quote for Indian portfolios.
#   * Cash 5% -- a working float; the real emergency fund is sized in months
#     of expenses, tracked separately in Settings.
#   * Real estate 5% -- REITs/InvITs only. A home you live in is not an
#     investment allocation and is deliberately excluded.
#   * Debt takes the remainder: EPF, PPF, FDs, debt funds, NPS-G.
