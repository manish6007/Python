"""Separate portfolios in one installation.

The problem this solves is not security, it is embarrassment: you cannot
show the app to anyone while your own salary and net worth are on the
screen. A profile is a whole separate database file -- switch to "Demo" and
every page shows that household instead, with nothing of yours reachable
from it.

It is deliberately not a login. On your own laptop a password box would be
theatre: whoever holds the machine can open the .db file whatever the
screen says. What profiles give you is separation, which is the part that
was actually missing. If this is ever hosted for other people, real accounts
belong on top of this boundary rather than instead of it -- every request
already carries which profile it is for.
